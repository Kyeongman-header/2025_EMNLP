How could he possibly have a job offer for me? Was he joking? Was he serious? My mind raced as I tried to make sense of what was happening. Was he trying to scare me into abandoning my immortality? Or did he genuinely want me to reconsider my discovery? As I stared at the business card, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong. Was my immortality somehow a curse? Was I doomed to suffer eternally? Or was there some other explanation for Death's bizarre request of me?",

To my astonishment, I saw the unmistakable specter of Death, his malevolent presence exuding an unmistakable aura of malevolence.\n\nBefore me stood a tall, skeletal figure, his eyes gleaming with mischief and malevolence. He handed me a business card, its glossy surface embossed with intricate patterns resembling skeletal crossbones. As I squinted to read the inscription, his voice echoed ominously:\n\n\"When you realize that living forever sucks, call this number. I've got a job offer for you.\"",

Perhaps Death's business card was a nudge towards discovering what truly mattered in our eternal existence. So I thanked Death for his wisdom and thanked myself for figuring out my own path. My immortality formula remained unchanged, but I found my purpose, and I was ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.",

We're scared. We're hungry. We're alone.\"\n\nI nodded solemnly, my heart heavy with the weight of their plight. I didn't know what to do, but I knew I couldn't abandon them here. Alone.

The woman, on the other hand, had only a single scar on her forearm, a reminder of a brutal assault she'd endured years prior. She'd tried to move on, but the memory still lingered.\n\nDespite their differing appearances, they found common ground—in their ability to share their stories. They talked about their traumas—one stemming from an accident, the other from an assault—and how they had shaped them into the people they were today.\n\nAs they conversed, they realized that perhaps the key to overcoming their scars lay in confronting them head-on—not denying or avoiding them. By doing so, they could hopefully find a way to heal—not just their physical wounds—but also their emotional and psychological traumas. And in doing so, they could hopefully find a way to move forward, hopefully leaving fewer scars behind.",

They had both experienced their fair share of trauma, but their paths had led them to different conclusions: he chose to embrace his disfigurements as a badge of honor, while she preferred to hide hers behind layers of makeup and accessories.\n\nAs they sat there, sipping coffee and chatting, I couldn't help but notice how contrasting their appearances were compared to what I assumed would be typical romantic pairs. Yet, despite their outward differences, there was an undeniable chemistry between them. Their conversation flowed effortlessly, almost effortlessly.\n\nIt struck me then how important it is to look beyond appearances when it comes to forming connections. Just because someone has a visible scar doesn't mean they aren't worthy of love or affection. In fact, those scars might even be part of what makes someone special. Their relationship served as a reminder that sometimes our differences can perfectly complement each other.",

The man tells her about his harrowing childhood accident and how he learned to live with his disfigurements, while the woman shares her heartbreaking breakup and how she found solace in self-love and self-acceptance. As they converse, they begin to see beyond their outward appearances and recognize the beauty that lies within themselves.

        "On an autumn morning in 21st-century New York City a man named John was sitting in his small apartment staring at his computer. He was a brilliant mathematician who spent most of his life trying to find a formula that could prove the existence of God. Years went by without any luck and John was bordering on the brink of insanity. One day while staring at his computer screen he saw something unexpected - a glimpse of God Himself!\n\nJohn asked \"Who are you? Why are you watching me?\"\n\nGod replied \"Your formula shouldn't be made public.\"\n\nJohn asked \"What do you mean?\"\n\nGod replied \"Your formula shouldn't be made public.\"\n\nJohn asked \"Why my formula shouldn't be made public?\"\n\nGod replied \"If you publish your formula you will lose your sanity.\" \n\nWhat happens next? Will John be able to resist the temptation? Will he be able to publish the formula without risking losing his sanity?",
        "On an autumn morning in 2012, mathematician Dr.Â.Â was sitting at his desk in his New York City apartment. He had spent years trying to find a formula that would prove the existence of God. Every day, every week, every month, every year, he spent hours upon hours trying to piece together the puzzle. Nothing worked. Nothing came close. Nothing mattered except for proving God's existence.\n\nFinally, after years of sleepless nights and hapless hapless hapless hapless hapless hapless hapless hapless hapless hapless hapless hapless hapless hapless hapless hapless hapless hapless,—he had it—a breakthrough! A breakthrough! A breakthrough! A breakthrough! A breakthrough! A breakthrough! A breakthrough!\n\nBut then, God intervened—God intervened—God intervened—God explained why the proof shouldn't be made public. Why? Why didn't God want the proof to be made public? ...",
        "On an autumn morning in 2006, the mathematician, Dr. John Smith was sitting at the desk of a cluttered apartment, surrounded by books and papers. He had spent years working on a formula to prove the existence of God. His obsession had driven him to the brink of insanity. One day, while reviewing his notes, Dr. Smith stumbled upon something that resembled a breakthrough. Excitedly, he ran tests and verifications until he was convinced that he had proven it. \n\nSuddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows and approached Dr. Smith. Dr. Smith was startled by the sudden appearance of God. God explained why the proof shouldn't be made public. Dr. Smith listened intently as God spoke, realizing that the proof shouldn't be shared publicly because it would disrupt the natural order of the universe. Overwhelmed by this revelation, Dr. Smith retreated into his apartment, vowing never again to meddle with matters beyond human comprehension.",
